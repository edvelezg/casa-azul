I have a dimension called Product. where I support a hierarchy of 

Company
    -Product
        -Model

However, some of the facts in the fact table specify values at a level 
higher in the hierarchy, like a product without a model, or the company 
without the product or the model.  A solution to this problem I think 
would be to add a value of unspecified for the product and model that were 
not specified, but I am wondering if there could be a problem in rolling 
up facts that have a value of unspecified for both Product and Model.  


Product
ProductID   Company     Product         Model
1           Apple       unspecified     unspecified
2           Apple       Ipod            4G
3           HP          Pavillion       m9020n
4           HP          unspecified     unspecified
