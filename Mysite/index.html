  <h1>About me.</h1>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Welcome to my personal homepage. I created this webpage so that I could keep my projects together and for general information about me. I am currently a MCS student under the guidance of Owen Kaser and Daniel Lemire, at the University of New Brunswick.</p>
  <p>Since I was an undergraduate student, I have seen great potential in how machines can aid research in various fields through Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). As the amount of information grows, better ways to analyze and access it become necessary. Scientists often need to analyze information gathered from different data sources, and when the amount of information is too vast, the information gathering process becomes slow. Often, the process is so slow that applications for data visualization take too long to support effective analysis. It is one of my career interests to address this problem through data warehouse techniques, such as indexing and view materialization. I am also interested in software engineering, especially in design aspects that allow building high performance software that is reusable and maintainable. From previous work during my undergraduate project, I also have an interest in wave propagation phenomena and their applications.</p>
