  <h1>About me.</h1>
  <p>&nbsp; </p>
  <p>Welcome to my personal homepage. I created this webpage so that I could keep my projects together and for general information about me. I am currently a MCS student under the guidance of Owen Kaser and Daniel Lemire, at the University of New Brunswick.</p>
  <p> My research interests include databases, wave propagation and the advancement of applied computer science in general. </p>
  <p>I have always seen great potential in how machines can aid research of different fields through OLAP. As the amount of information grows, better ways to analyze it and ways to access it become necessary. Scientists often need to analyze information gathered from different data sources and when the amount of information is too great the process becomes  slow. Often slow enough that having applications for data visualization takes way too long to do any analysis.</p>
  <p>I also find intereste in software engineering, especially in design aspects as to build software with high performarnce that is reusable, maintainable.  I have also gained interest in wave propagation phenomena and its applications, from previous work on this area during my undergraduate project.</p>
